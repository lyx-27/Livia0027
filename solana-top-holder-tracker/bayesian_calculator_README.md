# Bayesian Meme Coin Calculator

This Excel file (`bayesian_meme_calculator.xlsx`) contains a simple Bayesian model structure designed to help update the fundamental assessment of a meme coin based on new market data and social sentiment.

## Purpose

The model helps in quantifying the change in belief (prior probability) about a token's success into a new belief (posterior probability) after observing new evidence (e.g., a sudden volume spike, a whale accumulation, or a major social media trend).

## Usage

1.  **Input Data:** Input your initial belief (Prior Probability) and the likelihood of observing certain events (Likelihoods) into the designated cells.
2.  **Observe Evidence:** Input the observed market or social evidence (e.g., "Whale Accumulation Observed").
3.  **Calculate Posterior:** The model will automatically calculate the Posterior Probability, giving you an updated, data-driven assessment of the token's potential.

**Note:** This is a conceptual model for educational and analytical purposes. It should not be used as the sole basis for investment decisions.
